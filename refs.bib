  abstract = {We use the properties of independence estimating equations to adjust the 'independence' loglikelihood function in the presence of clustering. The proposed adjustment relies on the robust sandwich estimator of the parameter covariance matrix, which is easily calculated. The methodology competes favourably with established techniques based on independence estimating equations; we provide some insight as to why this is so. The adjustment is applied to examples relating to the modelling of wind speed in Europe and annual maximum temperatures in the U.K.},

The asymptotic properties of formal maximum likelihood estimators in such cases are outlined. In particular, applications in which only a single q × 1 vector of observations is observed are examined. Conditions under which consistent estimators of parameters result from the approximate likelihood using only pairwise joint distributions are studied. Some examples are analysed in detail.}

  abstract = {A class of estimating functions is proposed for the estimation of multivariate relative risk in stratified case-control studies. It reduces to the well-known Mantel-Haenszel estimator when there is a single binary risk factor. Large-sample properties of the solutions to the proposed estimating equations are established for two distinct situations. Efficiency calculations suggest that the proposed estimators are nearly fully efficient relative to the conditional maximum likelihood estimator for the parameters considered. Application of the proposed method to family data and longitudinal data, where the conditional likelihood approach fails, is discussed. Two examples from case-control studies and one example from a study on familial aggregation are presented.},

  abstract = {Large-scale surveys using complex sample designs are frequently carried out by government agencies. The statistical analysis technology available for such data is, however, limited in scope. This study investigates and further develops statistical methods that could be used in software for the analysis of data collected under complex sample designs. First, it identifies several recent methodological lines of inquiry which taken together provide a powerful and general statistical basis for a complex sample, structural equation modeling analysis. Second, it extends some of this research to new situations of interest. A Monte Carlo study that empirically evaluates these techniques on simulated data comparable to those in largescale complex surveys demonstrates that they work well in practice. Due to the generality of the approaches, the methods cover not only continuous normal variables but also continuous non-normal variables and dichotomous variables. Two methods designed to take into account the complex sample structure were investigated in the Monte Carlo study. One method, termed aggregated analysis, computes the usual parameter estimates but adjusts standard errors and goodness-of-fit model testing. The other method, termed disaggregated analysis, includes a new set of parameters reflecting the complex sample structure. Both of the methods worked very well. The conventional method that ignores complex sampling worked poorly, supporting the need for development of special methods for complex survey data.},
